# JCrypter

Cryptography methods implemented in Java Swing

## How to run

- Ensure that you have latest [JDK version](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.
- Compile with `javac`:

    ```shell
    $ cd src/
    $ javac jcrypter/JCrypter.java
    ```

- Run with `java`:

    ```shell
    $ java jcrypter.JCrypter
    ```

    _Notes_: after compiled, `javac` will generate plenty of `*.class` files. They are all ignored as in `.gitignore`.
